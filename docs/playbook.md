# OKR playbook

Our team uses Objective and Key Results (OKRs) to set challenging, ambitious, goals with measurable results. OKRs are how we track progress, create alignment, and encourage engagement around measurable goals. OKRs help us stretch for excellence as we show everyone the choices we've made as a team and team members, and how we're going to get there.

Our use of OKRs follows the [whatmatters.com](https://www.whatmatters.com/) guidance:

- [What is an OKR? Definition and examples](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example/)
- [Google's OKR playbook](https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/google-okr-playbook/)

## 2020Q4 guidance

### Setting OKRs

1. The Carbon team does not have any topline OKRs for Q4. We hope to do so in 2021 as both Q1 and annual OKRs.
1. The System Squad has 3-5 topline OKRs, with at least one of those being aspirational.
1. The Auxilary Squad is not doing topline OKRs. Instead, only frontline (individual) OKRs.
1. All team members have 3-5 OKRs.
1. Roughly 50% should cascade (contribute towards) squad OKRs (if on System Squad).
1. At lease one OKR is aspirational.

### Tracking OKRs

1. System Squad references and updates (modifies if necessary) its topline OKRs as part of each sprint planning.
1. Individual OKRs are discussed in every one-on-one.

### Scoring OKRs

1. Self-assessment and scoring happens at the end of each quarter.

### Using ZenHub

We use the [carbon-design-system/okrs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/okrs) GitHub repository with a ZenHub workspace to visualize through a roadmap and board. All GitHub [labels](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/okrs/labels) have descriptions to help guide usage.

- Each Objective and each of its Key Results are set as GitHub issues.
  - Two `objective` labels to denote committed or aspirational.
  - Top-line Objectives get a `team` or `squad` label.
  - Many `key result` labels to state its status.
  - GitHub issue "assignee" used to set Objective and Key Result owner.
- GitHub milestones are used so we can filter in ZenHub, e.g. `2020Q4`.
- Each Objective gets set as a ZenHub Epic so its Key Results can belong to it.
  - Key Results that are cascaded can become ZenHub Epics too.
- `score` labels are used at the end of each OKR cycle.
- ZenHub roadmap used to see all Objectives, grouped by team and squad.
